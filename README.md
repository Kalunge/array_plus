# Problem
Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

# Conditions
* the array can't be empty
* only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed
* Return nil for invalid inputs.

# Examples
For example the array `[2, 3, 9]` equals `239`, adding one would return the array `[2, 4, 0]`.

`[4, 3, 2, 5]` would return `[4, 3, 2, 6]`

# Acceptance criteria
* The solution is written using idiomatic ruby
* There are tests to verify the correctness of your solution
* DO NOT post a reply on the gist
